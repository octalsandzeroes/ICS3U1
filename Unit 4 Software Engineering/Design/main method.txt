get date method (returns a string and takes in a scanner object):
	declares a split date string array variable
	declares a date string variable
	initializes a boolean date chosen check as false

	prompts the user to enter a date in the 'DD/MM/YYYY' format
	while the boolean date chosen check is false:

list available rooms method (returns a string array and takes in the scanner object, the total rooms file name and reserved rooms file name):
	declare an reserved rooms string array, an available rooms string array, a total rooms string array
	declare a date string variable
	
	// this actually just the default sudo code to create an array of non duplicates lol
	assigns the date string variable the return value from the get date method (gives it the scanner)

	try:

		// creates the reserved rooms array
		reads through the reserved rooms list to the end and if the date string variable equals a line (date) in the file, increment the array length counter
		initializes the reserved rooms array with the length discovered above
		reads through the reserved rooms list to the end and if the date string variable equals a line (date) in the file, save next line (room) to the reserved rooms array

		// creates the total rooms array
		reads through the total rooms list to the end and increments the array length counter for each line read
		initializes the total rooms array with the length discovered above
		reads through the total rooms list to the end and saves each line (room) into the file

		// creating the available rooms array
		do a nested for loop to compare and count the number of available rooms on that date
		initializes a the available rooms array of length discovered above
		do a for loop to compare and save the available rooms into the new array
		
		closes the buffered readers
	catches an IO exception 
	
	returns the available rooms array


list reserved rooms method (returns a string array and takes in the scanner object and the reserved rooms file name):
	declare an reserved rooms string array
	declare a date string variable
	
	assigns the date string variable the return value from the get date method (gives it the scanner)

	try:

		closes the buffered reader
	catches an IO exception 
	
	returns the reserved rooms array


list available rooms method (returns void, takes in the scanner object, the total rooms file name and reserved rooms file name)
	declares an available rooms string array and a name string array
	declares a chosen room string variable
	initializes a name entered boolean as false and a room chosen boolean as false
	
	prompts the user for their first and last name
	while the name entered boolean is false:
		assigns the input string variable a scanner nextLine user input
		assigns the name string array to the input.split(" ", 0)
		if name string array.length is not equal to 2:
			print an error message that the name entered is invalid
		else:
			assigns the name entered boolean a value of true

	assigns the available rooms string array to a the return value of the list available rooms method (gives it the total rooms file name and reserved rooms file name as parameters)

	prints the array available rooms
	prompts the user to enter their chosen room
	while the room chosen boolean variable is false:
		try:
			assigns the chosen room string variable to an Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine()) + ""
		catches a NumberFormat exception and prints an error message that the entered room is invalid
		if the user input matches an element from the available rooms array:
			try:
				creates a new buffered writer output to the  with appending as true
				write a new line with the date of the reservation
				write a new line with the room number
				write a new line with the name string array in one line
			catches an IOExceptionbook
		if there is no match throw an error message and ask for another input
